/* classes and ids are attributes that can be added to html elements to make styling them easier
the main difference a class and an id in css is that a class be used multiple times but an id can only be used once
*/

/*
CSS uses something called specficity to determine which style rule to apply
Uses a weighting system
element name = 1
class = 10
id = 100

so whichever has the highest combined output wins and decides what style will be applied
*/
